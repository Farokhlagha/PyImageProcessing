# Basic Math Operation
This program uses [opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and numpy libraries.

## 1-Face Morphing
Morph one face into another using OpenCV. Your output should contain 5 images.

## 2-Black Hole
A real story in 2019:
Using image processing and numpy in images of a BLACK HOLE.

A simple task in 2023:
Use image processing and numpy to reduce noise in black hole images, then concatinate them together to make complete image.

## 3-Photo to Sketch
Using the division and GaussianBlur function, the image below is created.

## 4-Find The Secret Text
subtract operation was used to find the secret text.

## 5-Background Estimation
Calculated median of video frames to Make an image of empty road, without cars using scikit-image library.

## 6-Virtual Decoration
Use mask to apply new floor in the room.

### How to Install
